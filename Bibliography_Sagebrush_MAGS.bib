abstract={The field of microbiome research has evolved rapidly over the past few decades and has become a topic of great scientific and public interest. As a result of this rapid growth in interest covering different fields, we are lacking a clear commonly agreed definition of the term ``microbiome.'' Moreover, a consensus on best practices in microbiome research is missing. Recently, a panel of international experts discussed the current gaps in the frame of the European-funded MicrobiomeSupport project. The meeting brought together about 40 leaders from diverse microbiome areas, while more than a hundred experts from all over the world took part in an online survey accompanying the workshop. This article excerpts the outcomes of the workshop and the corresponding online survey embedded in a short historical introduction and future outlook. We propose a definition of microbiome based on the compact, clear, and comprehensive description of the term provided by Whipps et al. in 1988, amended with a set of novel recommendations considering the latest technological developments and research findings. We clearly separate the terms microbiome and microbiota and provide a comprehensive discussion considering the composition of microbiota, the heterogeneity and dynamics of microbiomes in time and space, the stability and resilience of microbial networks, the definition of core microbiomes, and functionally relevant keystone species as well as co-evolutionary principles of microbe-host and inter-species interactions within the microbiome. These broad definitions together with the suggested unifying concepts will help to improve standardization of microbiome studies in the future, and could be the starting point for an integrated assessment of data resulting in a more rapid transfer of knowledge from basic science into practice. Furthermore, microbiome standards are important for solving new challenges associated with anthropogenic-driven changes in the field of planetary health, for which the understanding of microbiomes might play a key role.},

abstract={The genome sequences of many species of the human gut microbiome remain unknown, largely owing to challenges in cultivating microorganisms under laboratory conditions. Here we address this problem by reconstructing 60,664 draft prokaryotic genomes from 3,810 faecal metagenomes, from geographically and phenotypically diverse humans. These genomes provide reference points for 2,058 newly identified species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which represents a 50{\%} increase over the previously known phylogenetic diversity of sequenced gut bacteria. On average, the newly identified OTUs comprise 33{\%} of richness and 28{\%} of species abundance per individual, and are enriched in humans from rural populations. A meta-analysis of clinical gut-microbiome studies pinpointed numerous disease associations for the newly identified OTUs, which have the potential to improve predictive models. Finally, our analysis revealed that uncultured gut species have undergone genome reduction that has resulted in the loss of certain biosynthetic pathways, which may offer clues for improving cultivation strategies in the future.},

abstract={Metagenomics, the application of shotgun sequencing, facilitates the reconstruction of the genomes of individual species from natural environments. A major challenge in the genome recovery domain is to agglomerate or `bin' sequences assembled from metagenomic reads into individual groups. Metagenomic binning without consideration of reference sequences enables the comprehensive discovery of new microbial organisms and aids in the microbial genome reconstruction process. Here we present MyCC, an automated binning tool that combines genomic signatures, marker genes and optional contig coverages within one or multiple samples, in order to visualize the metagenomes and to identify the reconstructed genomic fragments. We demonstrate the superior performance of MyCC compared to other binning tools including CONCOCT, GroopM, MaxBin and MetaBAT on both synthetic and real human gut communities with a small sample size (one to 11 samples), as well as on a large metagenome dataset (over 250 samples). Moreover, we demonstrate the visualization of metagenomes in MyCC to aid in the reconstruction of genomes from distinct bins.

Unlike classical clustering problem, contig binning can utilize known relationships among some of the contigs or the taxonomic identity of some contigs. However, the current state-of-the-art contig binning methods do not make full use of the additional biological information except the coverage and sequence composition of the contigs.We developed a novel contig binning method, Semi-supervised Spectral Normalized Cut for Binning (SolidBin), based on semi-supervised spectral clustering. Using sequence feature similarity and/or additional biological information, such as the reliable taxonomy assignments of some contigs, SolidBin constructs two types of prior information: must-link and cannot-link constraints. Must-link constraints mean that the pair of contigs should be clustered into the same group, while cannot-link constraints mean that the pair of contigs should be clustered in different groups. These constraints are then integrated into a classical spectral clustering approach, normalized cut, for improved contig binning. The performance of SolidBin is compared with five state-of-the-art genome binners, CONCOCT, COCACOLA, MaxBin, MetaBAT and BMC3C on five next-generation sequencing benchmark datasets including simulated multi- and single-sample datasets and real multi-sample datasets. The experimental results show that, SolidBin has achieved the best performance in terms of F-score, Adjusted Rand Index and Normalized Mutual Information, especially while using the real datasets and the single-sample dataset.https://github.com/sufforest/SolidBin.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

    abstract = "{Metagenomics investigates the DNA sequences directly recovered from environmental samples. It often starts with reads assembly, which leads to contigs rather than more complete genomes. Therefore, contig binning methods are subsequently used to bin contigs into genome bins. While some clustering-based binning methods have been developed, they generally suffer from problems related to stability and robustness.We introduce BMC3C, an ensemble clustering-based method, to accurately and robustly bin contigs by making use of DNA sequence Composition, Coverage across multiple samples and Codon usage. BMC3C begins by searching the proper number of clusters and repeatedly applying the k-means clustering with different initializations to cluster contigs. Next, a weight graph with each node representing a contig is derived from these clusters. If two contigs are frequently grouped into the same cluster, the weight between them is high, and otherwise low. BMC3C finally employs a graph partitioning technique to partition the weight graph into subgraphs, each corresponding to a genome bin. We conduct experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets to evaluate BMC3C, and compare it with the state-of-the-art binning tools. We show that BMC3C has an improved performance compared to these tools. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the codon usage features and ensemble clustering are used in metagenomic contig binning.The codes of BMC3C are available at http://mlda.swu.edu.cn/codes.php?name=BMC3C.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

abstract={Sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) comprises up to 99{\%} of the winter and 50{\%} of the summer diets of pygmy rabbits (Brachylagus idahoensis). Few animals specialize on such plants as sagebrush, which contain high levels of plant chemicals that can be toxic. We investigated the nutritional requirements of pygmy rabbits and their ability and propensity to consume sagebrush alone and as part of a mixed diet. We compared diet choices of pygmy rabbits with that of a generalist forager, the eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus). Pygmy rabbits had a moderately low nitrogen requirement (306.5 mg N/kg0.75/d), but a relatively high energy requirement, needing 750.8 kJ digestible energy/kg0.75/d to maintain their body mass while residing in small cages. They digested fiber in pelleted diets similarly to other small hindgut fermenters, but both cottontails and pygmy rabbits digested the fiber in sagebrush better than expected based on its indigestible acid detergent lignin content. Pygmy rabbits consumed more sagebrush than cottontails, regardless of the amount and nutritional quality of supplemental pellets provided. When consuming sagebrush alone, they ate barely enough to meet their energy requirements, whereas cottontails ate only enough sagebrush to meet 67{\%} of theirs. Both rabbit species ate more sagebrush as the quality and quantity of supplemental pellets declined, and more greenhouse-grown sagebrush than sagebrush grown outside. Urine was more acidic when consuming sagebrush than when consuming pellets, indicating detoxification by the liver. Pygmy rabbits do not require sagebrush to survive, but seem to tolerate terpenes and other plant chemicals in sagebrush better than cottontails do.},

ABSTRACT = {Quantifying western U.S. rangelands as a series of fractional components with remote sensing provides a new way to understand these changing ecosystems. Nine rangeland ecosystem components, including percent shrub, sagebrush (Artemisia), big sagebrush, herbaceous, annual herbaceous, litter, and bare ground cover, along with sagebrush and shrub heights, were quantified at 30 m resolution. Extensive ground measurements, two scales of remote sensing data from commercial high-resolution satellites and Landsat 8, and regression tree models were used to create component predictions. In the mapped area (2,993,655 km&sup2;), bare ground averaged 45.5%, shrub 15.2%, sagebrush 4.3%, big sagebrush 2.9%, herbaceous 23.0%, annual herbaceous 4.2%, and litter 15.8%. Component accuracies using independent validation across all components averaged R2 values of 0.46 and an root mean squared error (RMSE) of 10.37, and cross-validation averaged R2 values of 0.72 and an RMSE of 5.09. Component composition strongly varies by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) level III ecoregions (n = 32): 17 are bare ground dominant, 11 herbaceous dominant, and four shrub dominant. Sagebrush physically covers 90,950 km&sup2;, or 4.3%, of our study area, but is present in 883,449 km&sup2;, or 41.5%, of the mapped portion of our study area.},

However, both technologies suffer from the problem that sequencing depth of different regions of a genome or genomes from different species are highly uneven. Most existing genome assemblers usually have an assumption that sequencing depths are even. These assemblers fail to construct correct long contigs.Results: We introduce the IDBA-UD algorithm that is based on the de Bruijn graph approach for assembling reads from single-cell sequencing or metagenomic sequencing technologies with uneven sequencing depths. Several non-trivial techniques have been employed to tackle the problems. Instead of using a simple threshold, we use multiple depthrelative thresholds to remove erroneous k-mers in both low-depth and high-depth regions. The technique of local assembly with paired-end information is used to solve the branch problem of low-depth short repeat regions. To speed up the process, an error correction step is conducted to correct reads of high-depth regions that can be aligned to highconfident contigs. Comparison of the performances of IDBA-UD and existing assemblers (Velvet, Velvet-SC, SOAPdenovo and Meta-IDBA) for different datasets, shows that IDBA-UD can reconstruct longer contigs with higher accuracy.Availability: The IDBA-UD toolkit is available at our website http://www.cs.hku.hk/~alse/idba\_udContact:  chin@cs.hku.hk}",

Tests on simulated datasets revealed that MaxBin 2.0 is highly accurate in recovering individual genomes, and the application of MaxBin 2.0 to several metagenomes from environmental samples demonstrated that it could achieve two complementary goals: recovering more bacterial genomes compared to binning a single sample as well as comparing the microbial community composition between different sampling environments.Availability and implementation: MaxBin 2.0 is freely available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/maxbin/ under BSD license.Contact:  ywwei@lbl.govSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

  abstract = "We previously reported on MetaBAT, an automated metagenome
              binning software tool to reconstruct single genomes from
              microbial communities for subsequent analyses of uncultivated
              microbial species. MetaBAT has become one of the most popular
              binning tools largely due to its computational efficiency and
              ease of use, especially in binning experiments with a large
              number of samples and a large assembly. MetaBAT requires users to
              choose parameters to fine-tune its sensitivity and specificity.
              If those parameters are not chosen properly, binning accuracy can
              suffer, especially on assemblies of poor quality. Here, we
              developed MetaBAT 2 to overcome this problem. MetaBAT 2 uses a
              new adaptive binning algorithm to eliminate manual parameter
              tuning. We also performed extensive software engineering
              optimization to increase both computational and memory
              efficiency. Comparing MetaBAT 2 to alternative software tools on
              over 100 real world metagenome assemblies shows superior accuracy
              and computing speed. Binning a typical metagenome assembly takes
              only a few minutes on a single commodity workstation. We
              therefore recommend the community adopts MetaBAT 2 for their
              metagenome binning experiments. MetaBAT 2 is open source software
              and available at https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/metabat.",

  title    = "A parsimony approach to biological pathway
              reconstruction/inference for genomes and metagenomes",
  author   = "Ye, Yuzhen and Doak, Thomas G",
  abstract = "A common biological pathway reconstruction approach -- as
              implemented by many automatic biological pathway services (such
              as the KAAS and RAST servers) and the functional annotation of
              metagenomic sequences -- starts with the identification of
              protein functions or families (e.g., KO families for the KEGG
              database and the FIG families for the SEED database) in the query
              sequences, followed by a direct mapping of the identified protein
              families onto pathways. Given a predicted patchwork of individual
              biochemical steps, some metric must be applied in deciding what
              pathways actually exist in the genome or metagenome represented
              by the sequences. Commonly, and straightforwardly, a complete
              biological pathway can be identified in a dataset if at least one
              of the steps associated with the pathway is found. We report,
              however, that this na{\"\i}ve mapping approach leads to an
              inflated estimate of biological pathways, and thus overestimates
              the functional diversity of the sample from which the DNA
              sequences are derived. We developed a parsimony approach, called
              MinPath (Minimal set of Pathways), for biological pathway
              reconstructions using protein family predictions, which yields a
              more conservative, yet more faithful, estimation of the
              biological pathways for a query dataset. MinPath identified far
              fewer pathways for the genomes collected in the KEGG database --
              as compared to the na{\"\i}ve mapping approach -- eliminating
              some obviously spurious pathway annotations. Results from
              applying MinPath to several metagenomes indicate that the common
              methods used for metagenome annotation may significantly
              overestimate the biological pathways encoded by microbial
              communities.",

The higher order functional information is stored in the PATHWAY database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The PATHWAY database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. KEGG provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation.

Understanding the genetic diversity of these species and how it relates to adaptation to these stressors are necessary for guiding conservation and restoration efforts. This need is particularly acute for big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata; Asteraceae), which was once the dominant shrub over 1,000,000 km2 in western North America but has since retracted by half and thus has become the target of one of the largest restoration seeding efforts globally. Here, we present the first reference-quality genome assembly for an ecologically important subspecies of big sagebrush (A. tridentata subsp. tridentata) based on short and long reads, as well as chromatin proximity ligation data analyzed using the HiRise pipeline. The final 4.2-Gb assembly consists of 5,492 scaffolds, with nine pseudo-chromosomal scaffolds (nine scaffolds comprising at least 90\\% of the assembled genome; n = 9). The assembly contains an estimated 43,377 genes based on ab initio gene discovery and transcriptional data analyzed using the MAKER pipeline, with 91.37\\% of BUSCOs being completely assembled. The final assembly was highly repetitive, with repeat elements comprising 77.99\\% of the genome, making the Artemisia tridentata subsp. tridentata genome one of the most highly repetitive plant genomes to be sequenced and assembled. This genome assembly advances studies on plant adaptation to drought and heat stress and provides a valuable tool for future genomic research.}",
